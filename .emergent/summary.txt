<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested to fix a broken homepage caused by a faulty self-hosted video implementation. After fixing the video, the user requested a new Latest from our Newsroom horizontal slider on the homepage. This was followed by a large number of iterative UI/UX refinements for the slider and the main  page, including markdown rendering, styling adjustments, and data fetching logic changes. The scope then expanded to a major UI/UX overhaul across the  and  pages (and their respective detail pages) to ensure a consistent look and feel with the newly updated newsroom section. This involved adding pagination, standardizing card layouts, fonts, button styles, and fixing a non-functional share button.
