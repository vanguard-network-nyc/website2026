<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to fix a critical production deployment failure caused by the backend API returning  on Airtable errors, leading to 500 server errors. This was a blocker for the application's functionality.

Subsequently, the user initiated a series of rapid, iterative UI/UX requests. This included:
1.  ** page overhaul:** Combining two sections into a tabbed interface, adding/removing content, changing layouts from 2-column to 3-column, updating styles (gradients, text), and renaming multiple card titles.
2.  ** page overhaul:** Replicating the tabbed interface from the  page for three service sections. This involved significant refactoring of the monolithic  file, fixing section widths to ensure visual consistency, and adding visual indicators to connect tabs to their corresponding content.
3.  **Global Updates:** Changing links in the main navigation and renaming a primary route from  to .

The main challenge became the complex refactoring of the  page within a large, monolithic component file, which led to several page-breaking errors that had to be debugged and reverted.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is in a mostly functional state within the sandbox environment.
-   **Backend**: The critical error handling bug in  has been fixed. All endpoints that fetch data from Airtable now correctly return an empty list () on failure, preventing the 500 . The code is ready for deployment.
-   **Frontend**:
    -   The  page has been completely redesigned with a functional and styled tabbed interface.
    -   The  page also has a new tabbed interface. The layout and width issues have been resolved. The agent was in the middle of a final visual refinement to better connect the tabs to their content sections.
-   **Blocker**: The production deployment remains non-functional due to a platform-level configuration issue. The necessary  has not been set in the production environment's secrets, causing  errors.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was refining the UI on the  page to visually connect the new tabs with their respective content sections. The user was not satisfied with the agent's first attempt (which added a colored outline but removed rounded corners) and requested a better solution that brings the sections closer to the tabs, retains the rounded corners, and adds another visual indicator.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool. The agent needs to modify the styles in  and take a screenshot of the  page to verify the new visual connection.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Finalize Visual Connection on Advisory Page Tabs (P0)**
-   **Issue 2: Production Environment Configuration Failure (P1, Blocker)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Finalize Visual Connection on Advisory Page Tabs**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent added a colored border to the active section, but this removed the rounded corners and the user was not satisfied.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  View  and locate the tabbed interface for the  component.
        2.  Modify the CSS classes to bring the content sections closer to the tabs (e.g., by removing top margin ).
        3.  Implement a new visual indicator. A good approach would be to create a small caret or triangle element that sits on top of the active content section, pointing up towards the active tab.
        4.  Ensure the  class is preserved on the content sections.
        5.  Test the result with the screenshot tool.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To satisfy the user's UX requirement for a clear and aesthetically pleasing connection between the interactive tabs and the content they control.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

-   **Issue 2: Production Environment Configuration Failure**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has confirmed the Airtable token is correct in the sandbox and has correctly diagnosed that the token is missing from the production environment secrets. The agent has repeatedly informed the user about this.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: This issue cannot be fixed by the agent. The next step is for the user to add the  as a secret to their production deployment environment.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the root cause of the broken production site. Fixing it will make the application fully functional for end-users.
    -   **Status**: BLOCKED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: both
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Verify Production Deployment (P0)**: After the user confirms the  is set in the production environment, trigger and verify a new deployment.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **Refactor  (P2)**: The monolithic  file contains multiple pages (, , etc.) and should be broken down into individual component files. The recent work on this file highlighted its complexity and fragility.
    -   **Migrate  Page to Airtable (P2)**: The content for the  page is hardcoded and should be moved to Airtable.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Backend Resiliency**:
    -   Fixed brittle error handling in  for all 9 Airtable-related endpoints to return  instead of  on failure, resolving the primary deployment blocker.
-   ** Page Overhaul**:
    -   Implemented a tabbed interface for Current and Customized programs in .
    -   Updated the layout for Customized programs to a 3-column grid.
    -   Added, removed, and rearranged multiple content sections and cards.
    -   Standardized button gradients, enhanced tab UI for clickability, and updated all card titles as requested.
    -   Changed the layout for Current programs to a matching 3-column grid and removed the search/filter functionality.
-   ** Page Tab Implementation**:
    -   Created a tabbed interface in  for the three main advisory services.
    -   Reorganized page sections to follow a more logical flow.
    -   Fixed a critical page-breaking JSX syntax error after a failed refactoring attempt.
    -   Resolved a major layout issue by ensuring the width of all content sections below the tabs matched the tab container's width.
-   **Global UI & Routing**:
    -   Updated the MEMBER SITE button in the main navigation to be an external link.
    -   Renamed the  route to  and updated all 12 references across 9 files.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Platform Deployment Issue**: An infrastructure issue where the production environment () is missing the  secret. The agent has diagnosed it but cannot fix it.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The production deployment failure due to missing Airtable environment variables.
-   **Recurrence count**: 3+
-   **Status**: BLOCKED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Resilient API Design**: Modifying FastAPI endpoints to return a valid empty list () in  blocks to prevent  and 500 errors on the client.
-   **Complex React Refactoring**: Implementing tabbed interfaces using  and conditional rendering. The agent struggled with, and eventually succeeded in, refactoring a large monolithic component () to fix layout and structure issues.
-   **Debugging JSX**: Diagnosing and fixing page-breaking JSX syntax errors caused by improper tag closure during complex file edits.
-   **CSS Layout Debugging (Tailwind)**: Identifying the cause of visual width mismatches (nested containers, conflicting padding) and correcting the layout to achieve visual consistency.
-   **Risky Refactoring**: The agent's use of / and manual copy-pasting for large code blocks proved to be error-prone and led to several rollbacks using usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the fix for the backend error handling.
-   : Contains the completely refactored  page.
-   : The monolithic file containing the  page logic, which was the focus of the most recent, complex edits.
-   : Contains the updated route for the programs page.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Top Priority**: Your immediate task is to implement the user's feedback on the  page tabs. The user wants the content sections closer to the tabs, to keep the rounded corners, and to have a better visual indicator connecting the tab to the content. Avoid solutions that remove existing styling like rounded corners.
-   **The Real Blocker**: The production site is still broken due to a missing  in the production environment's secrets. Remind the user that even after UI fixes are complete, the production site will not work until they resolve this platform-level configuration issue.
-   ** is Fragile**: Be extremely careful when editing . The previous agent broke the site multiple times while refactoring it. Make small, incremental changes and test with screenshots frequently. Avoid large-scale copy-pasting or script-based modifications.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
-   The last 10 messages focus on the UI/UX of the  page. The user pointed out that the content sections were narrower than the tabs. The agent fixed this, but the user was then unsatisfied with the visual connection between the tabs and content, requesting a more refined design that is tighter, retains rounded corners, and provides a clearer visual link. The last message is this pending request.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The application remains broken in the production environment due to the missing Airtable secret.
-   **Mocked**: None.

**3rd Party Integrations**:
-   Airtable: Used as a headless CMS for events, team members, articles, etc. Requires .

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO (but probably should have been, given the multiple  cycles).
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: The JSX structure in  was broken and restored multiple times. The current state is functional but has pending UI refinements.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Airtable Access Token**:  (This is valid for the sandbox).

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not forget a task, but it struggled to execute the  page layout refactoring cleanly, leading to multiple errors, rollbacks, and user frustration. It has not yet successfully implemented the user's final visual refinement request for the advisory tabs.</analysis>
