<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to finalize a series of content and layout updates. This evolved into a comprehensive, multi-phase SEO overhaul. After the SEO work was completed, the user requested a major refactor of the monolithic  file and other enhancements. During this process, a critical UX bug emerged: when navigating between pages, the new page renders at the bottom and visibly scrolls to the top. The user is now blocked and highly frustrated by this persistent scroll issue, which has become the top priority.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React-based website with a FastAPI backend. A significant SEO overhaul has been completed, including the implementation of  for meta tags, creation of  and , and the integration of Google Analytics/Search Console. The final SEO task, adding  schema to detail pages, was completed in this session using a custom  hook to bypass issues with . Basic PWA support (, , icons) has been added. The codebase suffers from a large monolithic file, , which contains logic for multiple pages. An attempt to refactor this file failed and was reverted. The most critical aspect of the current state is a persistent and unresolved page transition scroll bug.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Fixing a critical and recurring page transition bug. When a user scrolls down a page and clicks a navigation link, the new page loads at the previous scroll position and then visibly scrolls to the top, creating a jarring user experience. The agent has made multiple failed attempts to fix this, including modifying scroll handlers, creating a custom  component, and removing Framer Motion animations from over 25 files, which broke the site's design and had to be reverted.
-   **Status**: BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: Y (Agent's tests showed improvement, but the user confirmed the issue persists on key pages, indicating the fix was unsuccessful.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent. The test should involve:
    1.  Navigating to the homepage, , , , , and .
    2.  On each page, scrolling to the absolute bottom.
    3.  Clicking a link in the main navigation header to go to a different page.
    4.  Asserting that the new page renders *instantly* at the top (scroll position 0) with no visible scrolling animation from the bottom.
-   **User Testing Done**: Y (User has repeatedly confirmed the issue is not fixed).

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Page transition scrolls from bottom to top (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
-   **Issue 2: Executive Advisory Team Card Alignment on  page (P2 - DEPRIORITIZED)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Page transition scrolls from bottom to top**
    -   **Attempted fixes**:
        1.   in  component: Did not solve the race condition with rendering.
        2.  Centralizing scroll logic in : Ineffective.
        3.  Custom  component to scroll : Did not solve the issue as navigation and rendering still happened before the scroll completed visually.
        4.  Removing page-level  entrance/exit animations: This was a destructive approach that broke the site's design, introduced numerous errors, and still did not fully resolve the underlying problem. All these changes had to be reverted.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: The core issue is a race condition between React Router's rendering and Framer Motion's . The new page component mounts at the old scroll position before the scroll-to-top logic can execute cleanly.
        1.  **Review **: Check the current implementation of  and .
        2.  **Create a  component**: This component will wrap every page route in .
        3.  **Implement  in **: Inside the wrapper, use . This ensures the scroll to top happens before the browser paints the component, which is more effective than the  in the shared  component.
        4.  **Remove other scroll logic**: Remove the now-redundant  component from  and any / scroll logic from individual pages to avoid conflicts.
        5.  **Test thoroughly**: Verify on all pages the user mentioned (, , , , , homepage).
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical UX bug that makes the site feel broken. Fixing it is essential to unblock the user and restore confidence.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None. This is the main blocker.

-   **Issue 2: Executive Advisory Team Card Alignment on  page**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: A flexbox fix was rejected by the user.
    -   **Next debug checklist**: Do not work on this. It has been explicitly deprioritized by the user.
    -   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: User confirmation.

**In progress Task List**:
- None. The refactoring task was reverted.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P1) **Fix ESLint warnings**: After the scroll bug is fixed, run  to clean up warnings for unescaped entities () and other minor issues.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   (P1) **Refactor **: Break down the monolithic file into individual page components under  and homepage sections under . This must be done incrementally (one component at a time) with testing after each extraction to avoid repeating the previous failure.
    -   (P2) **Expand Schema Markup**: Implement  schema on more relevant pages like  and .
    -   (P3) **Enhance PWA Functionality**: Add an offline fallback page to the service worker.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Core of the application routing and page transitions. It's central to the scroll bug.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components.js**: The monolithic component containing several pages. It was the target of a failed refactoring and multiple scroll-fix attempts.
-   **All Page Components** (e.g., , ): These were modified to remove animations in a failed attempt to fix the scroll bug. These changes were reverted.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Contains global styles, including a  rule that was modified during debugging.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **/app/frontend/src/components.js**: This remains a critical technical debt. It contains the code for , , , , and several homepage sections, making the file extremely large and difficult to maintain.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The page transition scroll bug is the absolute highest priority (P0).** The user is very frustrated and blocked. Do not attempt any other task until this is fully resolved and verified by the user.
-   **Do not remove animations.** The previous agent's attempts to fix the scroll bug by removing Framer Motion animations were incorrect. The solution must work *with* the existing design and animations.
-   The user has lost patience with failed attempts. Propose a clear, robust plan and execute it carefully. The suggested  approach is a standard pattern for this exact problem and has a high probability of success.
